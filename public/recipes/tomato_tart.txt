Fresh Tomato Tart (New York Times Magazine)<br><br>
The Pastry:<br>
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour, plus extra flour for rolling out the pastry<br> 1/2 tsp salt<br> 1 T sugar<br> 12 T cold butter cut into bits<br> 4 T ice water<br><br>

The Filling:<br>
1/3 cup Dijon mustard<br> 1 lb. mozzarella, or cheddar, thinly sliced<br> 10 medium-sized, firm ripe tomatoes, thinly sliced<br> 1 T chopped garlic<br> 1 tsp dried oregano<br> salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br> 2 T olive oil<br><br>
1. Prepare the pastry by combining the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor. Add the butter and combine until coarse crumb consistency. With the machine running, add the water through the feed tube and run the machine until the pastry rolls off the sides of the container into a ball. (You can also make this by hand without a food processor.)<br>
2. Cover the pastry and refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br>
3. Roll out the dough with a little flour into a circle large enough to fit into a 10" tart pan, about 1/8" thick. Prick pastry with fork, to let out air. (At this point the pastry shell can be frozen until used.)<br>
4. Preheat the oven to 400.<br>
5. Evenly brush the mustard over the bottom of the pastry shell.<br>
6. Top the mustard with all of the cheese slices (you can even use a mixture of cheese; I tend to use cheddar). Cover the bottom completely. <br>
7. Beginning at the outer edge of the shell, make a layered overlapping row of the tomato slices. Make a second row and then fill the center with a final circle of tomatoes.<br>
8. Sprinkle the top evenly with the garlic and oregano. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and drizzle the olive oil over all.<br>
9. Put the pie on a baking sheet and bake it in the oven for about 40 minutes.<br>
Yields: Six to eight servings.
