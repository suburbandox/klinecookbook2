Tessie's Mushroom Puff Pastries<br><br>
Fry chopped mushrooms in butter with salt, black pepper, dried mustard, and cayenne. Add sherry or dry wine and let mixture cook down until mushrooms are brown and saturated with the juice. Make sure the mushrooms are spicy because otherwise they lose flavor when put inside the puff pastry. You could also add thyme, and maybe garlic powder if you want it.

Mix mushroom mixture with cream cheese until thoroughly blended. Cut rolled out puff pastry into little squares. Put about a t or however much fits into each square. Fold in half. Prick top with fork and brush with egg mixture. Can either be frozen at this point or baked at 375 for about 15-20 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Should be baked directly from the freezer or immediately after making.
