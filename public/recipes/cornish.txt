Cornish Pastry - from English postcard<br><br>
Pastry: <br>4 oz. flour<br> 2 oz. fat<br>pinch of salt mixed with just enough cold water to make a firm pastry dough.
<br><br>
Filling: <br>Potato finely sliced<br> an onion<br>some turnip finely cut<br> 4 oz. of steak that may be chuck or skirt, cut into little pieces<br> salt and pepper to taste. (They used a lot of pepper.)<br><br>

Method: <br>Roll pastry into a round. On one half put some sliced potato, then some onion and a little turnip which can be left out if not to your taste. Put meat on top and add seasoning. A few thin slices of potato will save meat from drying. Wet edges of pastry and fold it over 3/4 of the way, bringing up other edge to meet it. Crimp these together by pinching with left hand and folding over with right. Thus you have made a rope like edge to your pastry. Put it on baking sheet and bake in 425 for 7-10 minutes then 350 for 30 minutes.

Can probably make this with turkey as well.
