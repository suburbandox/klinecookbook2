New York Times - Mushroom Turnovers (about 2 dozen)<br><br>
9 oz. of cream cheese at room temperature<br> 1 1/2 cups flour<br> 1/2 cup butter, at room temperature. <br>(You can use regular pie dough instead)<br><br>
1. Mix the cream cheese and the butter thoroughly. Add the flour and work with the fingers or pastry blender until smooth. Chill well, for at least thirty minutes.<br>
2. Preheat oven to hot (450)<br>
3. Roll the dough to 1/8" thickness on a lightly floured surface and cut into rounds with a 3" biscuit cutter. Place a teaspoon of mushroom filling on each and fold the dough over the filling. Press the edges together with a fork. Prick top crusts to allow for the escape of steam.<br>
4. Place on an ungreased baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.<br><br>

Mushroom Filling:<br>
3 T butter<br> 1/2 t salt<br> 1 large onion, finely chopped<br> 2 T flour<br> freshly ground pepper to taste<br> 1/2 lb. mushrooms, finely chopped<br> 1/4 t thyme<br> 1/4 sweet or sour cream. <br><br>
1. In a skillet, heat the butter, add the onion and brown lightly. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, about three minutes.<br>
2. Add the thyme, salt, pepper, and sprinkle with flour.<br>
3. Stir in the cream and cook gently until thickened.<br><br>

Instead of the cream cheese dough or pie dough you may use puff pastry. Roll it out to 1/8" cut into squares and stuff with mushroom mixture. You can also use cream cheese in the mushroom mixture instead of the sour cream. If you do use puff pastry cook at 425 for about 15 minutes or until golden brown. Don't forget to prick the puff pastry with a fork and then brush with a beaten egg.
