Dough: <br>1 1/2 c flour<br> 1 pkg quick-rising active dry yeast<br> 1/2 t salt<br> 1/2 t sugar<br> 1 T olive oil<br> 1/2 c warm water (115 to 120 degrees)
<br><br>
Filling: <br>1 lb. sweet Italian sausage; 3/4 c chopped red onion; 2 t minced garlic; 1/4 t red pepper flakes; 1 (10 oz.) pkg. frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry in clean kitchen towel; 1/2 c skim ricotta cheese; 1/4 c plus 3 T grated imported Parmesan cheese<br> 1/4 t salt<br> 1/8 t freshly ground pepper<br> 12 oz. whole or skim shredded mozzarella cheese<br> 1 3/4 c pizza sauce<br> 1 egg, beaten.<br><br>

1. To prepare dough, combine 3/4 c flour, yeast, salt, sugar, olive oil and water in mixing bowl, and stir with spoon to blend. Stir in remaining 3/4 c flour, and mix until dough forms shaggy mass. Removed dough from bowl, and knead on floured surface three to four minutes or until smooth and soft. <br>
2. Place dough in greased mixing bowl and set in warm place about 1 hr. or until almost doubled in bulk. Punch down dough, and shape into a round. Pinch off a 1/3 of the dough, and set aside. Roll larger piece on floured surface into 13 or 14 inch round. Mold dough into greased 9 inch spring form pan so that dough hangs slightly over the rim of pan. Place pan plus extra dough, in refrigerator while you prepare filling.<br>
3. For filling, saute sausage in skillet, breaking it into small pieces with spoon, until lightly browned. Add onion, garlic and pepper flakes, and saute, stirring, two to three minutes or until onion is softened. Drain mixture well on paper towels and then transfer to mixing bowl. Add spinach, ricotta, quarter cup Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, and mix well.<br>
4. Spread half of mixture in dough-lined pan. Sprinkle with one-third of mozzarella cheese and 1 T Parmesan cheese. Then sprinkle remaining third of mozzarella and remaining 1 T Parmesan over top.<br>
5. Roll remaining dough on floured surface into 10" round. Place over filling in pan. Brush edges of round with beaten egg. Fold overhanging dough over and pinch two doughs together. Crimp and push toward sides of pan to form edge. Make two 2 inch slits in top of dough. If not baking immediately, refrigerate up to three to four hours.<br>
6. Bake at 450 degrees on center shelf 15 minutes. Then cover loosely with foil, and bake 25 minutes or until crust is slightly browned. Remove foil, and cool 10 minutes. Remove sides of pan. Cut into wedges. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
