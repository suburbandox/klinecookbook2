Pizza<br><br>
1. Prepare dough. Place 1 package of dry yeast, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 1/4 cup of warm water in bowl, set aside for 5 minutes or until foamy. Add to this 2-4 cups of flour, 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of milk, a little salt and a little olive oil. Form dough out of this combination. Let rise for 45 minutes, punch down and rise some more. Punch down.<br>
2. Meanwhile heat pizza stone at 450 degrees for at least 30 minutes. <br>
3. Cut dough in half and spread half over pizza stone (be careful it is very hot). Add tomato sauce (see recipe) and toppings: sliced peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, pre-cooked Italian sausage, anchovies, smoked mussels, clams or oysters, cheese (definitely mozzarella, but parmesan, cheddar, Swiss and feta are all good) and anything else.
4. Cook for 15 minutes or until top is bubbling and bottom down is somewhat brown.
