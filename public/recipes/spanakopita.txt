Chaya's Spanakopita<br><br>
1-10 oz. pkg. of spinach<br> 1-8 oz. pkg. feta<br> 1 box filo dough <br> 2 sticks butter<br> 1 sm. Onion<br> oregano<br> pepper<br> 4 eggs<br> olive oil<br><br>
1. Take the spinach and tear off the stems. Do the vegetarian equivalent of soaking and salting the spinach (cover it with salt, tear the spinach into small pieces, then rinse off the salt). Set spinach aside.<br>
2. Cut up onion and saute in olive oil. Put onion into a large mixing bowl. Crumble in feta, oregano, eggs and a generous amount of black pepper.<br>
3. Melt 1 stick of butter. Bring out the filo dough and a 9x13" pan. Butter the pan, then butter the first sheet of filo dough and lie it in the pan. Butter the next sheet and lie it down on top of the first one, starting to make a fan of the filo dough leaves. Continue this for 8 to 10 sheets, then add the rest of the cheese/egg stuff. Top with a few more buttered sheets of filo dough, then fold the edges of the filo dough on top. Butter the edges of the dough down.<br>
4. Bake at 350 for 50 minutes or until golden brown on top. <br><br>This recipe is not great for cholesterol restricted people, but it tastes GREAT (according to the person who gave it to me on the recipe tree).
