Can make little ones as well by rolling out the pastry. Then cutting it into little squares. Paint each individual square with egg mixture. Put a little square of brie inside of it. Fold square in half. Paint with egg mixture. Prick top with fork. Bake in a greased pan at 375 for about 20 minutes. Watch so these don't burn. If you don't want to make and eat these immediately - freeze them. They should be cooked directly from the freezer.
