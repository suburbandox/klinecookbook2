Geezer's Onion Soup<br><br>
1. Saute 4 large onions (sliced into rings which are then broken up) with 3 large cloves of garlic in olive oil until veggies are translucent (at a medium heat so onions won't brown).<br>
2. Add 2-3 tablespoons of flour and brown it, briefly.<br>
3. Add two cups of dry wine; 2 bay leaves; pepper; tabasco sauce (optional) and simmer 10 minutes.<br>
4. Add 5-8 cups of chicken broth (preferably not salty), and gently boil for 30 minutes.<br>
5. Add more wine, sherry, pepper, and salt to taste, cook another 10 minutes<br>
6. Make baked onion soup: place in oven-proof crock, add French bread, and top with cheese (parmesan and Swiss is good combination).<br>
7. Or add cheese directly to soup and add some milk. Melt cheese at medium temperature, try not to boil.
