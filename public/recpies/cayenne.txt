Cayenne Shortbread (6 dz.)<br><br>
1 t cayenne pepper<br> 1 t salt<br> 2 1/2 c flour<br> 1/2 lb. cheddar or Gruyere cheese grated<br> 1/2 lb. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature<br><br>
1. Sift salt, pepper, and flour - set aside.<br>
2. Using an electric mixer, cream together the cheese and butter until well blended. Gradually add the dry ingredients. If dough becomes too thick, use a wooden spoon to stir it.<br>
3. Divide dough into half and shape into logs 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 9 inches long. Wrap well in plastic and chill for at least 1 hour or freeze. The dough may be frozen and baked just before serving.<br>
4. Preheat oven to 350. Generously butter several baking sheets or line them with parchment paper.<br>
5. Using a sharp knife cut logs into 1/4 inch slices and place the wafers on the prepared baking sheets. Bake just until slightly colored, approximately 15-20 minutes. Remove from baking sheets and let cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container.
