Geezer's Caesar Dressing<br><br>
Into large wooden salad bowl, rub two cloves of garlic until they become mush. Mash into garlic, 1/2 can of anchovies, with or without capers (do not use oil). Add 1 lemon, 3/4 cup of olive oil (pour in slowly while beating to emulsify), and 1/8 - 1/4 cup of wine vinegar, and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Add 1 egg which has been placed in boiling water for one minute. Add grated parmesan, salt, pepper, more lemon juice and anchovies to taste.
You may place these same ingredients in a food processor in the same or larger quantities (do not use more than one egg), and result in a dressing which will last there for 1-2 weeks.
