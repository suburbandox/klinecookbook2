Tessie's Chicken Curry Appetizers<br><br>
Defrost filo dough. Take a stack of sheets and cut them into strips about 2" wide. You have to be careful when working with filo dough because it tends to dry out very quickly. Cover the portion of filo dough that you are not working with. Take each individual strip 2" wide by 8" long and spread it with melted butter. Do the same with two other strips right on top. Then put a t of the chicken curry mixture on top. Fold into a strip. Brush top with melted butter and put on a greased pan. Bake 425 for 15 minutes until golden brown.<br><br>

Chicken curry mixture: Boil chicken. Take chicken off the bone and cut into tiny pieces. In a sauce pan melt butter, add curry, coriander, turmeric, and other curry spices with black pepper. Sprinkle in flour and cook a few seconds until mixture becomes clumpy. Add milk and cook until sauce is thick. Make sure it is spicy enough because mixture will bland out once inside of the filo dough. Add chicken and mix well. Let mixture cool a bit before putting inside the filo strips.
