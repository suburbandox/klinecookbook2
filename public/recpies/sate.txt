To make the marinade, combine the brown sugar, curry powder, peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, and crushed chilies to taste in a shallow dish. Thread the chicken pieces on bamboo skewers, weaving skewers in and out of the meat lengthwise to create a serpentine design. Place the skewers in the soy sauce mixture. Marinate at room temperature for at least 2 hours or in the refrigerator as long as overnight for a more intense flavor.

To make the peanut sauce, combine peanut butter, coconut milk, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar or molasses, ginger, garlic, and cayenne pepper to taste in a saucepan over moderate heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is as thick as heavy cream, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a food processor or blender and puree briefly. (This mixture can be made several hours ahead and refrigerated. Return to room temperature before serving.)

Prepare a moderate charcoal fire in an open grill or preheat the broiler.

Cook the skewered chicken, turning several times and basting with the marinade, over medium-hot coals (or under a broiler) until crispy on the outside but still moist inside, about 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with lime zest and garnish with cilantro leaves. Serve with the room-temperature peanut sauce for dipping. 

Makes about 18 skewers; allow 2 per serving as appetizer or 4 or more as main course.
