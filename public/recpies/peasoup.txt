Pea Soup<br><br>
Soak peas overnight or bring to boil and soak for an hour or so. Then in:<br>

Microwave:<br> 1 bag of peas (green or yellow)<br> water<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> 1.5 onion (chopped)<br> pepper<br>Microwave at 5 minute intervals, checking water level (that some remains, because it will be absorbed into peas) for approximately 1 hour, until peas have mostly dissolved into mush. Then add 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, pepper, salt, and tabasco to taste. You can also add mushrooms and pepperoni at this stage and cook a few more minutes.<br><br>

Stove-top: same thing, but it is easier to use two bags of peas and double the water. Takes 2-3 hours to simmer.
