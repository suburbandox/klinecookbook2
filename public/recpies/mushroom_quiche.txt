Quiche Dough from The French Chef Cookbook by Julia Child <br><br>
2 cups flour<br> 1 stick (4 oz.) chilled butter<br> 3 T chilled shortening<br> 1/3 cup ice water<br> 1 egg<br> 1 tsp. salt<br> 1/8 tsp. sugar<br><br>
1. Place flour in large bowl. Cut the butter and shortening into 1/4" pieces, and add to the flour. Mix until mixture looks like very coarse meal.<br>
2. Beat the ice water, egg, sugar and salt to blend. Pour into the flour and butter, and mix at moderate speed for a few seconds until dough clogs in the blender.<br>
3. Turn out onto a board and press the dough out and away from you with the heel of your hand in quick rough 6" smears. This constitutes final blending of fat and flour, and incorporates any too-large bits of fat. Scrape dough into a ball, dust lightly with flour, and wrap in waxed paper. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Flour needs rehydrating and butter needs chilling before dough can be rolled easily. (Dough may be frozen.)<br><br>
